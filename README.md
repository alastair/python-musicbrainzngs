## Musicbrainz NGS bindings

This library implements webservice bindings for the Musicbrainz NGS site, also known as /ws/2.

For more information on the musicbrainz webservice see <http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/XML_Web_Service>.

### Usage

    # Import the module
    import musicbrainzngs

    # If you plan to submit data, authenticate
    musicbrainzngs.auth("user", "password")

    # Tell musicbrainz what your app is, and how to contact you
    # (this step is required, as per the webservice access rules
    # at http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/XML_Web_Service/Rate_Limiting )
    musicbrainzngs.set_useragent("Example music app", "0.1", "http://example.com/music")

    # If you are connecting to a development server
    musicbrainzngs.set_hostname("echoprint.musicbrainz.org")
